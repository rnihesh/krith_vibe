Problem statement - 3
Traditional file management relies on rigid, manual hierarchies of
folders and sub-folders that quickly become disorganised and
inefficient. The Semantic Entropy File System (SEFS) challenge
tasks you with developing a self-organising file manager that
replaces static directories with a dynamic semantic layer
integrated directly into the operating system. Instead of requiring
users to categorise files manually, the system must autonomously
analyse the content of documents and project them into a live
file structure (for example: Graph, FlowChart, Spatial Map, etc.). In
this environment, files with high conceptual similarity
automatically converge into meaningful folders, while unrelated
documents remain separated.
All semantic processing must operate on files located within a
single monitored root folder. Within this root directory, the system
must dynamically organise files into multiple semantic folders
based on their content. Each folder should contain only the files
that conceptually belong together.
Unlike conventional file managers, this semantic structure must
function at the OS level rather than as a standalone visualisation
tool. The system should monitor file operations such as creation,
modification, renaming, and deletion, and continuously
synchronise semantic organisation with the operating system
’
s file
view. When semantic relationships change, the OS-level folder
structure must update accordingly.
The core difficulty lies in maintaining a
“living
”
semantic layout: as
new data is introduced or existing content changes, the system
must re-calculate file positioning, update the OS-integrated folder
structure, and apply live changes in real time without breaking
file integrity or disrupting normal system operations.
Expected Outcomes
1. Auto-Detection & Processing: A system that monitors a single
root directory and automatically processes any new or modified
PDF or text file added to the operating system.
2. Semantic Folder Organisation: Content-based logic that
dynamically creates and maintains multiple folders inside the root
directory, ensuring each folder contains only semantically related
files.
3. OS-Level Synchronisation: Bidirectional consistency where
semantic reorganisation updates the operating system
’
s folder
structure, and any manual OS-level file action triggers semantic
re-analysis.
4. Interactive Interface with Live Changes: A visual 2D interface
where files are represented as nodes, users can hover for
metadata and open files, and where the layout reflects live
changes whenever semantic recalculation occurs.
